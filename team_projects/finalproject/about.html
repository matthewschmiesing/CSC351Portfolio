        <h1>About Granda Edna</h1>
        <p> 
            
            Hello there. My name is Edna, and I’ve spent the last sixty years in my kitchen, perfecting recipes that are good enough to eat but nothing too fancy. Cooking has been my daily routine, from peeling potatoes just right to stirring soup in a slow, steady circle. Over the years, I’ve learned a few things—like why you should always set a timer (a lesson from an overcooked roast in 1973).  
            
            I started this blog because my granddaughter, Lily, said people like reading stories about food. “Grandma, you should write down all the little things you tell me while we cook,” she said. “Like how you know when bread dough is ready just by the feel of it.” I told her that’s just something you learn with time, but she insisted. So here I am, typing with fingers that are more used to kneading than clicking away on a keyboard.  
            
            Today, I thought I’d start with soup—chicken soup, to be exact. The kind you make when the air turns crisp and someone in the house starts sniffling. My mother made it, and her mother before her, though I’ve adjusted it over the years. A little less salt, a little more thyme. The trick, I’ve found, is in the patience. Let it simmer, let the flavors talk to each other. Stir in a slow, steady circle. And always taste as you go.  
            
            If you’re looking for fancy food, you won’t find it here. But if you like meals that taste like home, I hope you’ll pull up a chair. After all, a good recipe isn’t just about the ingredients—it’s about the stories that come with it.</p>
